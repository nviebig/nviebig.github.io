        Hi, I’m Niklas — a physicist and MSc student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch), working at the interface of climate modeling, atmospheric dynamics, and planetary systems.

        I’m driven by questions like:

        - How can we combine physical theory and data to make climate models more accurate, adaptive, and transparent?
        - How can we use these models to learn more about exoplanets - constraining important parameters e.g. for live, just by looking at their spectras
       

        My core goal: **building better models** — models that are fast, flexible, and grounded in physics.  
        That includes:

        - **Physics-based simulation** – solving conservation laws to model the dynamics of Earth’s and other planets’ climates  
        - **Machine learning for physics** – learning subgrid or uncertain processes like clouds and convection directly from data  
        - **Differentiable modeling** – enabling simulators to learn via automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization  
        - **High-performance computing** – running efficient, scalable simulations for experimentation and hybridization

        In September, I’ll start my master’s thesis with [Milan Klöwer](https://milankl.github.io) (Oxford) and [Siddhartha Mishra](https://math.ethz.ch/sam/the-institute/people/siddhartha-mishra.html) (ETH), working on differentiable general atmospheric models using SpeedyWeather.jl and Enzyme.jl, exploring how climate models can adapt to observations in real time — and what this means for simulating extremes and exoplanet climates.

        So far, I’ve worked on projects from probabilistic wildfire modeling in Brazil to planetary instrumentation, with a shared focus: using computational physics to extract meaning from messy systems.

        You can find more of what I’ve worked on at [GitHub](https://github.com/nviebig). :) And if you want to chat about ML for weather/climate, exoplanets, or rewriting physics in Julia — reach out.
