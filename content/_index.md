        I‚Äôm a master‚Äôs student in Physics at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), focusing on **scientific computing**, **climate modeling**, and **planetary systems**.

        So far, I‚Äôve worked on:
        - üõ∞Ô∏è **Grating nuller prototyping** for the [LIFE Mission](https://life-space-mission.com), with Fourier optics simulations and experimental calibration for exoplanet interferometry.
        - üåø **Bayesian wildfire modeling** across the Amazon Basin, forecasting spatio-temporal fire risk from meteorological and land-use data.
        - üåç **Geospatial dashboard** for the Sahel (START Hack 2025), combining 20 years of land productivity, rainfall, and population data for sustainable land use.
        - ü™ê **Coronagraph simulation tool** to optimize JWST data pipelines.
  
        My long-term interest is leveraging hybrid physics‚ÄìML models to Earth‚Äôs climate and exoplanetary systems ‚Äî blending *theoretical physics*, *scientific software*, and *real-world impact* with the goal of understanding our planet better.
