      title: 'About me'
      text: |-
        I’m a master’s student in Physics at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), focusing on  **climate modeling**, and **planetary systems** to learn more about habitability on earth and our neighbors.
       
        So far, I’ve worked across projects regarding planetary instrumentation, applied probabilistic modeling, and geospatial data analysis to learn about wildfires in Brazil, and applied tools from physics, statistics, and machine learning to problems in Earth and planetary science.
        Find more about what ive worked on on [GitHub](https://github.com/nviebig). :)

        My goal is to learn about the use of physics-informed ML, numerical simulation, and scientific software to study climate systems, atmospheric processes, and the physical mechanisms that shape planets — both on Earth and beyond.
