    summary: |
      Master's thesis on integrating online machine learning into global climate models to perform dynamic downscaling and bias correction during runtime. The project explores how ML modules, trained on high-resolution regional simulations or reanalysis data, can correct fields like precipitation or surface winds on-the-fly and feed them back into the model. This enables cheap global models (e.g. SpeedyWeather.jl) to produce accurate high-resolution outputs while preserving physically meaningful dynamics. Co-supervised by the Exoplanet and Habitability group (Oxford) and the Seminar for Applied Mathematics (ETH).
