about: |
  I‚Äôm a physics master‚Äôs student at ETH Zurich with a focus on scientific machine learning, climate modeling, and exoplanetary habitability. For my thesis, I‚Äôll be visiting the University of Oxford to work on differentiable climate simulations using SpeedyWeather.jl and Enzyme, co-supervised by Milan and Siddhartha Mishra.

  My academic interests lie at the intersection of computational science and planetary systems‚Äîmodeling Earth's climate more efficiently and extending insights to extrasolar atmospheres.

  Outside of research, I‚Äôve interned at Strategy& (PwC) where I applied AI to optimize research workflows, and at Linklaters in M&A compliance. I also enjoy hiking, competitive problem-solving, and exploring new domains at hackathons.
